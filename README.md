# FEM_demo
Demonstration of material stress and strain calculated using the Finite Element Method. Includes use of simplified, consistent, and exact (using force method) methods for the FEM problem of a beam with a fixed-fixed boundary conditions subjected to distributed load across half the length of the beam. The beam is loaded by its own weight. The beam has a rectangular cross section with a width b = 1 and the height h(x) varying linearly between h0 and hL.
